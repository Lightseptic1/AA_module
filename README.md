# Bubble Sort & Insertion Sort

quick notes for reference

---

### Bubble Sort
- goes through the list multiple times  
- compares each pair of items  
- swaps them if out of order  
- keeps doing this until no swaps left  

**complexity:**  
- best: O(n)  
- average: O(n²)  
- worst: O(n²)  
- space: O(1)

---

### Insertion Sort
- builds the sorted list one element at a time  
- takes each new element and inserts it into the correct spot among the previous ones  

**complexity:**  
- best: O(n)  
- average: O(n²)  
- worst: O(n²)  
- space: O(1)
